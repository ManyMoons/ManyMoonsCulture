    intro:

      desc:
        We believe that an American education is the best in the world. Our 
        mission is to help students and parents to reach their dreams of 
        receiving an American education. We specialize in helping families 
        through the application process, visa process and securing a homestay 
        while studying in America. This process can be complicated and difficult 
        for many students but our promise is that we will provide an honest and 
        complete service for our families.
    philosophy:
      title: International Boarding Philosophy
      desc:
        Homestay is a unique feature of our boarding program. We believe that 
        international students living with American families creates a much 
        better educational environment and provides more social and emotional 
        support than an impersonal boarding dorm. Host families are carefully 
        chosen after a background and reference check and personal interviews.
        Orientation and ongoing support is provided for both host families and 
        international students.

    history:
      title: School History
      desc:
        <p>
          Eastside Christian Schools was established as part of the Eastside 
          Christian Church ministry in 1976. David Schoen has been the lead 
          administrator since 1980 when the school was a preschool through 
          fifth grade campus of 100 students.
        </p>
         
        <p>
          The school grew rapidly during the 1980's, filling the space that 
          Eastside Christian Church was able to provide at the time. As the 
          church added facilities, the school was given additional office and 
          classroom space as well. As part of the growth process, grades were 
          added up through eighth grade.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          As Eastside Christian Schools matured, it became apparent that the 
          school needed to become a separate corporation to expand our 
          Christian school ministry to additional locations as well as to 
          add a high school.
          Today Eastside Christian Schools has grown to become a fully 
          accredited educational program and operates two school campuses in 
          the City of Fullerton California. At Eastside you will find a 
          comprehensive educational program for all age groups from preschool 
          through twelfth grade.

        Traders Point Christian Academy was founded in 1976 and continues to 
        build a reputation of being one of the most respected private 
        Christian schools in Indiana. The school mission statement reflects 
        a commitment to providing exceptional academics within a Biblical 
        worldview as part of an effort to educate the whole student.
    about:
      title: About Traders Point
      desc:
        Traders Point Christian Academy (TPCA) is a private Christian school 
        that serves northwest Indianapolis and outlying areas. We believe 
        that a complete education includes imparting knowledge and developing 
        skills in the framework of a Christian values system. Knowledge 
        involves critical life skills such as learning vocabulary and math. 
        Skill development is the application of knowledge, which allows 
        children to become more self-directed and sets the stage for lifelong 
        learning. But knowledge and skills are not enough to equip a child to 
        succeed in the world. The heart must be enriched with a value system 
        through which knowledge is evaluated, skills are applied, and decisions 
        are made. Teaching Biblical worldview provides the value system through 
        which students learn how God wants them to behave, react, and respond 
        to life. A complete education expands the mind and enriches the heart. 
        That's our goal at TPCA. Join us in fulfilling our mission.

        Tonight we were discussing high school and I asked her what she thought. 
        She simply said, "I love it". She does not say this lightly. She grew 
        up in public schools, she has cousins and an Uncle, Aunt and Grandparents 
        that go to and work or worked in public schools. She sees and knows the 
        difference and she is grateful for where her education is taking place.

        In the spirit of seeking and sharing positive things in my life, I 
        couldn’t resist telling you about an amazing lesson that I witnessed 
        this morning. The teacher was launching a science unit about space. 
        These are the things that amazed me&#58; clearly stated student expectations, 
        compliments for students meeting the expectations, calm warnings given to 
        students not living up to the expectations stated, the lesson employed 
        excellent use of technology, including music, humor and pictures that 
        allowed comparison of something as large as planets and stars to be 
        clearly seen by the students. 

        The format of the lesson was deliberately 
        thought out with a catchy introduction, teaching that integrated God’s 
        great hand in creation and challenged the students, as scientists, to 
        solve a problem which was tested right there during the class. I 
        continue to be amazed by the teaching creativity and excellence of the 
        teachers. Way to go!!!

        Many Moons Cultural Exchange is an organization that exists to promote personal growth and building community through the discussion and experience of culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        The emphasis of a Many Moons event is first-hand experience. Where books, movies and the media can give us a glimpse of life in other countries, a Many Moons event allows people to try things themselves. It’s the difference between seeing a beautiful Christmas tree and decorating one yourself, knowing that Americans eat turkey at Thanksgiving and tasting it yourself. 
      </p>

      <p>
        So if you’re curious about other cultures and like to explore, come to an event at our center and experience something new.

      title: Mission of Many Moons Educational Consultation
      desc:
        <p> 
          Many Moons Cultural Exchange is an organization that exists to promote 
          personal growth and building community through the discussion and 
          experience of culture.
        </p>

        <p> 
          Many Moons Educational Consulting continues that vision by acting as a 
          cultural bridge to give students the opportunity to fully enter the 
          American high school experience. We believe that studying in America 
          has value that goes beyond an American diploma. It can profoundly 
          influence students’ worldview and self-image in a way that will 
          benefit them for the rest of their lives. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          Because we realize that every student is different, our services are 
          specifically geared to help parents and students fulfill this vision.  
          From the application process, visa process and updates from host 
          families even after the students arrive in America, our company will 
          be your partner all along the way.  
        </p>

        <p> 
          The cultural excursion is also a great way for parents and students 
          to get a firsthand look at the American educational environment and 
          also experience our company's and partner's services first hand. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          We believe our cultural excursions to America and direct relationships 
          with American schools will inspire confidence in families who are 
          looking for an honest and reliable partner for their child's education.
        </p>

            professional experience in the development and design of 
            e-enabled web solutions. He believes that software development 
            is both an art and science and strives to be a "software 
            craftsman" rather than a strict engineer. Prior to joining 
            Many Moons Culture Exchange, Daniel worked in a variety of 
            environments ranging from large Fortune 500 companies to 
            small technology startups.

            Daniel graduated from University of California Irvine with a BS 
            in Information and Computer Science. Graduation was just the 
            beginning as he continues to research new trends and best

            on it for almost 10 years. After experiencing both, his preference

          “Many Moons” is the title of a children’s book by James Thurbur, a noted 
          American author and illustrator. In it, a princess asks for the moon, 
          but when the king summons his wise men to figure out how to get it for 
          her, all they come up with is reasons why it’s impossible. In the end, 
          it is the court jester who finds the answer, and it is just a matter of 
          making a simple paradigm shift. But in the end, isn’t that one of the 
          hardest things for us to do?
        </p>

        <p>
          Hard, but not impossible. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We want to challenge people to change the way they think. By exposing 
          people to other cultures, by valuing creativity and imagination, we want 
          to encourage people to look at the world in a different way, and in so 
          doing, perhaps to find the answers they’ve been looking for.
