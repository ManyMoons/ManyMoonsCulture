    intro:

      desc:
        We believe that an American education is the best in the world. Our 
        mission is to help students and parents to reach their dreams of 
        receiving an American education. We specialize in helping families 
        through the application process, visa process and securing a homestay 
        while studying in America. This process can be complicated and difficult 
        for many students but our promise is that we will provide an honest and 
        complete service for our families.
    philosophy:
      title: International Boarding Philosophy
      desc:
        Homestay is a unique feature of our boarding program. We believe that 
        international students living with American families creates a much 
        better educational environment and provides more social and emotional 
        support than an impersonal boarding dorm. Host families are carefully 
        chosen after a background and reference check and personal interviews.
        Orientation and ongoing support is provided for both host families and 
        international students.

    title: Cultural Exchange
    desc:
      <p>
        Many Moons Cultural Exchange is an organization that exists to promote personal growth and building community through the discussion and experience of culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        The emphasis of a Many Moons event is first-hand experience. Where books, movies and the media can give us a glimpse of life in other countries, a Many Moons event allows people to try things themselves. It’s the difference between seeing a beautiful Christmas tree and decorating one yourself, knowing that Americans eat turkey at Thanksgiving and tasting it yourself. 
      </p>

      <p>
        So if you’re curious about other cultures and like to explore, come to an event at our center and experience something new.
      </p>

    mission:
      title: Mission of Many Moons Educational Consultation
      desc:
        <p> 
          Many Moons Cultural Exchange is an organization that exists to promote 
          personal growth and building community through the discussion and 
          experience of culture.
        </p>

        <p> 
          Many Moons Educational Consulting continues that vision by acting as a 
          cultural bridge to give students the opportunity to fully enter the 
          American high school experience. We believe that studying in America 
          has value that goes beyond an American diploma. It can profoundly 
          influence students’ worldview and self-image in a way that will 
          benefit them for the rest of their lives. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          Because we realize that every student is different, our services are 
          specifically geared to help parents and students fulfill this vision.  
          From the application process, visa process and updates from host 
          families even after the students arrive in America, our company will 
          be your partner all along the way.  
        </p>

        <p> 
          The cultural excursion is also a great way for parents and students 
          to get a firsthand look at the American educational environment and 
          also experience our company's and partner's services first hand. 
        </p>

        <p> 
          We believe our cultural excursions to America and direct relationships 
          with American schools will inspire confidence in families who are 
          looking for an honest and reliable partner for their child's education.
        </p>
